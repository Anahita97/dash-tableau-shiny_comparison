# Dashboard technology comparison: Dash, Tableau and Shiny
### Research carried out by the students of DSCI 532 MDS 2021/2022 



|     | Dash | Tableau | Shiny |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----- |
| **History** - Is this technology mantained by a company or it is open source (or both)? When and why was created?  Are there future steps in the development of this technology that you can understand from what you read? Are other companies involved in the current development of this technology that was not the original one?  | [group_30](group_30.md)     |  [group_29](group_29.md)        |  [group_28](group_28.md)      |
| **Scope** - Is possible to be used with different languages (Python / R / Julia / excel / others)? Provide the link to the official webpage and main public repo of this technology. If possible, provide the number of stars in the main repository. Number of questions open in Stack Overflow. Are there other relevant forums / chats where you can ask questions about this technology? Number of issues opened in the main repository. How popular is this technology? Is it mostly used in academia or industry (or both)? Cite your sources | [group_27](group_27.md)     | [group_26](group_26.md)        |  [group_25](group_25.md)     |
| **Frontend** - Design layout. List documentation (official or not) where you can find how to create good layout designs with this technology. Are there recommendations or tutorials? At what level the layout is customizable? Can you use bootstrap? How easy it is to use it?  | [group_24](group_24.md) | [group_23](group_23.md) | [group_22](group_22.md) |
| **Reactivity** - How you generate a reactive plot? Can you point (1) the basic way to create a reactive plot and also (2) how to create a plot reactive to more than one input and (3) how to create more than one reactive output (for example having a plot and text to print on the screen)?    |  [group_21](group_21.md)       |  [group_20](group_20.md)     |[group_19](group_19.md)
|  **Documentation and reproducibility** - (1) Mention all the official documentation resources. (2) Are there ways to reproduce the code of the app from your repo locally (ie., Docker? Binder? Nothing is said about it?) Provide examples if you find that is possible.   |  [group_18](group_18.md)    |   [group_17](group_17.md)      |  [group_16](group_16.md)     |
| **Backend** - Common plots (interactive or not) used in this technology. What are the most used plotting libraries? Describe the limitations in plots / possibilities using extra packages that you can have using this technology.  |  [group_15](group_15.md)     | [group_14](group_14.md)         |  [group_13](group_13.md)      |
| **Testing and databases** - (1) List packages or other technologies used for testing the app. Is a common practice for this technology? After reading, why do you think it is or it is not important? (2) It is easy to connect external databases? Can you mention resources about that? | [group_12](group_12.md)     | [group_11](group_11.md)        | [group_10](group_10.md)      |
| **Deployment** - List all the possible ways to deploy and share this technology using a link. Are all of them free? Explore and describe the most you can all the options.  | [group_9](group_9.md)     |  [group_8](group_8.md)       | [group_7](group_7.md)      |
| **Performance and Examples** - How to improve the performance of this dashboard?  Provide an extensive list of examples of relevant apps (published or in galleries or repos). Why are there relevant? (define some criteria)? Do you find more apps for industry or academia?| [group_6](group_6.md)     |   [group_5](group_5.md)      |  [group_4](group_4.md)     |
| **Resources** - Famous conferences - workshops - twitter accounts to follow - blogpost/webpages - sources of material about this technology - Podcasts - Discord/Slack communities - YouTube Channels. Provide the most extensive list of resources you can with a short description. Where do you find more material? Where would you suggest someone to start learning from this technology? | [group_3](group_3.md)      |   [group_2](group_2.md)       |  [group_1](group_1.md)      |
