## Shiny - Documentation and Reproducibility

### Brief description

Shiny is an R package for building interactive web apps straight from R. You can visit [Shiny Website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for the most useful resources on mastering shiny or look for help from [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/shiny/8?_ga=2.131532047.1822684614.1646988228-658982915.1642896472) or [shinyapps-users Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/shinyapps-users). 

To ensure the Shiny app is deployed under a reproducible environment, there are two tools we can use: [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

#### Shiny - Run the dashbaord in a reproducible way locally
To ensure the app is deployed under the same configuration as your local application, there are two tools we can use here. 

1. `{renv}`

`{renv}` package allows one to have a project-based library so others can run the dashboard locally.
To create a reproducible renv library, here are the steps to follow:




2. Docker
