## Dash: Frontend
### Brief description

Plotly's Dash provides a tighlty-integrated frontend that can be written in Python. It is used to build a graphical user interface around the data analysis code. The main aspects of a Dash frontend are the multitude of components, the interactivity between those components, and the customizability supported by those components. Users can design the look of the application using the application's layout by creating interactive components like graphs, dropdowns, sliders, or date ranges and can even add HTML tags. Dash also provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to customizing the look of the application. Users can use their own CSS or JavaScript files, set a favicon, and embed images, among other advanced options.
